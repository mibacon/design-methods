<div class = "poem">
I met a traveller from an antique land, <br>
Who said &#8211 "Two vast and trunkless legs of stone <br>
Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,  <br>
Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown, <br>
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command, <br>
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read <br>
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things, <br>
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed; <br>
And on the pedestal, these words appear: <br>
My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings; <br>
Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair! <br>
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay <br>
Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare <br>
The lone and level sands stretch far away."
