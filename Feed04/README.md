# All the Feels

Theoretical proces of emotional read of Browsing History: 
1 - use chrome extension to track browsing history
2 - chrome extension removes all text content and isolates images
3 - download images only (over a certain size, so no icons)  - can I use phantom.js to take screen grab of images only?
4 - run downloaded images through emotion API
5 - push image (preferably maintaining original image placement) and color assignment, along with time stamp, to running feed.

Theoretical process of emotional read of webcam:
1 - run webcam
2 - connect webcam feed to emotion API using node
3 - push emotion color assignment to background of feed page, along with time stamp.
